  <strong> App Objective:</strong><br>
  Create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI for a Weather-Journal App.<br>
  <br>
  <strong> Building process:</strong><br>
  1- Set up the server-side JS by installing node applications dependencies which include (express, body-parser, cors).<br>
  2- Create an API key using the Open Weather Map https://openweathermap.org/.<br>
  3- Set up the client-side JS by setting up the web URL and the API key.<br>
  4- Create the asynchronous fetch functions to add a GET route and a POST route.<br>
  5- to start the project: in the terminal we write: node server.js, and in the browser we write the used localhost:<portnumber>.<br>
  6- We will use the city zipcode to get the city data from weatherMap site. "you can use the zipcode 94040 for trial".<br>
  7- The app's final preview shows the received temperature from the weather map page, the date, and the user input (feeling).<br>
